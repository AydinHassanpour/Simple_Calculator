#Simple Calculator

This is a basic calculator program written in Python. It allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and calculating square roots. 

The project is intended for beginners to practice and improve their Python skills. By implementing this calculator, new programmers can gain hands-on experience using features like:

- Input/output operations  
- Control flow tools (loops, conditionals)
- Arithmetic operations
- Handling errors
- Modular coding with functions

## Features

- Perform basic math operations:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
- Calculate square root of a number  
- Repeated operations with loop
- Input validation for errors
- Clear code with comments

Follow the on-screen prompts to choose an operation, enter numbers, and view the result. 

Select 6 to quit the program.

## Customizing

The code is open for customization and improvements:

- Add more math functions 
- Validate inputs
- Use loops for repeating operations
- Format outputs as required
- Add features like logs, trigonometry etc.
